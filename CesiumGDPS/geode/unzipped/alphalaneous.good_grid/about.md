# Good Grid

## <cb>The ultimate DrawGridLayer rewrite and API!</c>

- <cg>Better Performance!</c>
- <cg>Rotation Support!</c>
- <cg>Extensive API</c>
- <cg>Bug Fixes</c>
- <cg>Exactly Like Vanilla (by default)</c>

<cr>Editor Extension in MegaHack cannot be detected, thus the grid size will too small unless you enable extension override in this mod's settings.</c>

Here's what you can do with the API as a Developer:

## LineColor

This is a class that contains up to 2 colors for solid or gradient lines. When passing one into the constructor, both color A and B equal the same value. If you pass two colors, the line will be a gradient between the two. 

```cpp
LineColor(GLubyte r, GLubyte g, GLubyte b, GLubyte a);
```
Constructor with rgba bytes.

```cpp
LineColor(const cocos2d::ccColor4B& colorA);
```
Constructor with one color, will make the line solid.

```cpp
LineColor(const cocos2d::ccColor4B& colorA, const cocos2d::ccColor4B& colorB);
```
Constructor with two colors, will make the line a gradient between the two colors.

```cpp
cocos2d::ccColor4B getColorA() const
```
Returns the first color.

```cpp
cocos2d::ccColor4B getColorB() const
```
Returns the second color if it is set, else returns the first color.

## DrawGridAPI.hpp

```cpp
void markDirty()
```
Marks the grid as dirty, forcing it to update it's culling bounds.

```cpp
bool isDirty()
```
Returns true if the grid is marked as dirty.

```cpp
void setVanillaDraw(bool enabled)
```
Sets the grid rendering to Vanilla's implementation (used mostly for debugging, should not be used in a mod).

```cpp
bool isVanillaDraw()
```
Returns true if vanilla draw is enabled.

```cpp
void setLineSmoothing(bool enabled)
```
**Line smoothing is only supported on Windows and MacOS!**
Sets all lines to smooth (useful for editor camera rotation)

```cpp
bool hasLineSmoothing()
```
**Line smoothing is only supported on Windows and MacOS!**
Returns true of line smoothing is enabled

```cpp
void setLineSmoothingLimit(float limit)
```
**Line smoothing is only supported on Windows and MacOS!**
Sets the editor zoom limit (if >= than this limit, the lines will not be made smooth) for line smoothing as having too many smoothed lines on screen at once is laggy. I recommend keeping it at default.

```cpp
float getLineSmoothingLimit()
```
Returns the line smoothing limit

```cpp
void overrideGridBoundsSize(cocos2d::CCSize size)
```
Sets the grid's max width and height bounds (useful for editor extenders and limiters).

```cpp
cocos2d::CCSize getGridBoundsSize()
```
Returns the max width and height bounds of the grid.

```cpp
void overrideGridBoundsOrigin(cocos2d::CCPoint origin)
```
Sets the grid's origin (bottom left) coordinates.

```cpp
cocos2d::CCPoint getGridBoundsOrigin()
```
Returns the coordinates of the grid's origin.

```cpp
cocos2d::CCSize getWorldViewSize()
```
Returns the World View size. This size is the window size scaled by the editor zoom multiplied by the overdraw factor to account for rotation.

```cpp
float getOverdrawFactor()
```
Returns the overdraw factor for the rotated editor view.

```cpp
void drawLine(const cocos2d::ccVertex2F& start, const cocos2d::ccVertex2F& end, const LineColor& color, float width, bool blend = false)
```
Draws a line to the screen with two coordinates where it starts and ends. Takes in a LineColor param which allows for a solid or gradient color. The width is the line width, for the purpose of optimization, this also determines Z ordering for that specific width. Blending is an optional param that will make the line blend with additive blending.

```cpp
void drawRect(const cocos2d::CCRect& rect, const cocos2d::ccColor4B& color, bool blend = false)
```
Draws a rectangle to the screen with a CCRect param dictating the bounds and a color param to set its color. Blending is an optional param that will make the rectangle blend with additive blending.

```cpp
void drawRectOutline(const cocos2d::CCRect& rect, const cocos2d::ccColor4B& color, float width, bool blend = false)
```
Draws a rectangle outline to the screen with a CCRect param dictating the bounds, a color param to set its color, and the width of the outline. Blending is an optional param that will make the rectangle outline blend with additive blending.

```cpp
bool isObjectVisible(GameObject* object)
```
Util to check if an object is visible (accounting for selecting, group and hide options).

```cpp
geode::Result<DrawNode&> getNodeByID(const std::string& id)
```
Returns a result of a DrawNode if one by the passed in ID exists.

```cpp
template <typename T>
requires std::is_base_of_v<DrawNode, T>
geode::Result<T&> getNode(const std::string& id)
```
Returns a result of a DrawNode if one passed by the type and ID exists.

```cpp
template <typename T>
requires std::is_base_of_v<DrawNode, T>
geode::Result<T&> getNode()
```
Returns a result of a DrawNode if one passed by the type. Will always be first of a type if multiple exist.

```cpp
template <typename T, typename... Args>
requires std::is_base_of_v<DrawNode, T>
T& addDraw(const std::string& id, Args&&... args)
```
Returns a reference of and adds a custom DrawNode to the DrawGridLayer with an ID.

## DrawNode.hpp

This class is what makes up every part of the new DrawGridLayer. Every layer on it inherits this class. It provides a few methods as well as some virtuals you can override that will be called when added via the DrawGridAPI. You usually do not need to manually construct this yourself, as DrawGridAPI::addDraw will construct one for you and return it.

```cpp
void setID(const std::string& id)
```
Sets the ID of the DrawNode.

```cpp
std::string getID() const
```
Returns the ID of the DrawNode.

```cpp
void setEnabled(bool enabled)
```
Sets if the DrawNode is enabled (should draw to the DrawGridLayer).

```cpp
bool isEnabled() const
```
Returns true if the DrawNode is enabled (will draw to the DrawGridLayer).

```cpp
void setZOrder(int order)
```
Sets the Z order of the DrawNode, note that this is width exclusive, it will draw in this order per line width, then rectangles, then rectangle outlines. 

```cpp
int getZOrder() const
```
Returns the Z order of the DrawNode.

```cpp
virtual void init(DrawGridLayer* drawGridLayer)
```
A virtual you can override that will be called whenever the DrawGridLayer is created.

```cpp
virtual void draw(DrawGridLayer* drawGridLayer, float minX, float maxX, float minY, float maxY);
```
A virtual you can override that will draw what is within it to the DrawGridLayer, The minX, maxX, minY, and maxY params are the culling bounds, these respect scale and rotation, please use these for the best performance.

## DrawLayers.hpp

Every method here has an optional priority param, it is used if you need to run your code after or before something else. (For static changes such `setColor` methods, the highest number is the only one that ends up getting set. `setPropertiesFor` methods will be in order of prio and all will run).
